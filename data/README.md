# Data Structure Taxonomy

## Rationale

This taxonomy is designed to support nationwide 1031 exchange replacement property identification while maintaining deep local market knowledge in Jacksonville, FL. The service taxonomy groups 26 services into seven categories: Timelines (45/180 day management), Structures (three property rule, 200 percent rule, reverse exchanges, DST), Execution (rent roll analysis, T12 review, capex planning, market comps, lender preflight), Tax (boot planning, basis calculations, depreciation), Reporting (Form 8824, compliance documentation), Property Paths (multifamily, industrial, retail, medical, self storage, STNL), and Education (identification strategies, identification letter preparation). The location taxonomy includes 23 locations within 30-45 miles of Jacksonville, prioritizing neighborhoods, suburbs, and business districts that investors recognize, plus a nationwide option for remote identification support. Property types focus on NNN single tenant retail assets aligned with investor search intent, including convenience stores, drive-thru QSR, pharmacies, dollar stores, and medical facilities. This structure enables systematic content generation through batch prompts while ensuring each service and location page uses a different layout variant through round-robin assignment, creating visual diversity across the site while maintaining consistent information architecture and compliance standards.
